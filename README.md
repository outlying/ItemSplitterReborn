# Item Splitter Reborn

This is fork of https://github.com/Ilione/CookyItemSplitter addon, which at this time seems to be abandoned and last updated for Shadowlands

## About 

This addon allows to split any stackable items into smaller stacks of custom size. 

While this might not seems very useful at first it comes handy for guild bank management, especially when we want to give access to some resources (like potions, flasks) in limited quantity to our guild members.
